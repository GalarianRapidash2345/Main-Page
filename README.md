# Welcome to my ePortfolio 

This ePortfolio serves as a suitable demonstration and introduction to my abilities within the computer science and software engineering industries. The ePortfolio process consists of a code review, three artifact enhancements, and a self-assessment to provide the viewer with substantive information on how I approach software-related problems. Throughout the ePortfolio, I demonstrate how to approach problems, while utilizing realistic situations that are commonly found in the industry. I then utilize the realistic situations for solving the problems at hand. To illustrate this process, the content of the ePortfolio should be discussed. First, the code review analyzes and plans enhancements for original software artifacts for the software design/engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases categories. The three artifact enhancement pages detail the software solutions, while displaying the before and after states of the original artifact. The self-assessment guides the viewer on my experiences and my background, which assists the viewer on understanding the choices made for the artifacts. Using realistic situations, I applied such processes to my content. Thus, I encourage the viewer to be inspired by the approaches, design processes, imperfections, and solutions within this ePortfolio.
