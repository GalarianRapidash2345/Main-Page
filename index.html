<h1>Clara Kellermann-Bryant</h1>
<p>This ePortfolio serves as a practical demonstration and introduction to my abilities within the computer science and software engineering industries. 
  The ePortfolio process consists of a code review, three artifact enhancements, and a self-assessment to provide the viewer with substantive information on how I approach software-related problems. 
  Throughout the ePortfolio, I demonstrate how to approach issues while utilizing realistic situations commonly found in the industry. 
  I then use real cases for solving the problems at hand. Illustrating this process, I should discuss the content of the ePortfolio. 
  First, the code review analyzes and plans enhancements for original software artifacts for the software design/engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases categories. 
  Next, the three artifact enhancement pages detail the software solutions while displaying the before and after states of the original artifact. 
  Finally, the self-assessment guides the viewer on my experiences and background, which assists the viewer in understanding the choices made for the artifacts. 
  Using realistic situations, I applied such processes to my content. 
  Thus, I encourage the viewer to be inspired by the approaches, design processes, imperfections, and solutions within this ePortfolio.</p>
